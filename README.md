# EXP-2-PROMPT-ENGINEERING-

## Aim: 
To conduct a comparative analysis of different types of prompting patterns and explain them with various test scenarios.
The experiment demonstrates how broad/unstructured prompts differ from basic/clearer prompts in terms of response quality, accuracy, and depth.

## ALGORITHM 

Common Scenario: A user wants to generate creative writing about a "mysterious old book."

## 1. Zero-Shot Prompting
### Description:
This is the simplest form of prompting, where the model is given a prompt without any examples or specific instructions beyond the core request. It relies entirely on the model's pre-trained knowledge to generate a response.

### Test Scenario:
"Write a short story about a mysterious old book."

### Algorithmic Output Aim:
A creative and coherent short story, potentially incorporating elements of suspense, discovery, or hidden knowledge, based on the model's understanding of "mysterious old book" and "short story."

## 2. Few-Shot Prompting

### Description: 
In this pattern, the model is provided with a few examples of input-output pairs before being given the actual prompt. This helps the model understand the desired format, style, or type of response.

### Test Scenario: 
"Example 1:

Input: "Describe a talking dog."

Output: "Barnaby, a scruffy terrier with an uncanny vocabulary, greeted me with a polite 'Good morning, chap!' and a wag of his tail. He then proceeded to explain the merits of chasing squirrels."

Now, write a short story about a mysterious old book."

### Algorithmic Output Aim:
A short story that mimics the descriptive and somewhat whimsical style of the provided examples, focusing on characterization and perhaps anthropomorphizing the book or its effects.

## 3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

### Description:
CoT prompting encourages the model to break down complex problems into intermediate steps, showing its reasoning process. This is particularly effective for tasks requiring logical deduction or multi-step problem-solving. While primarily for reasoning tasks, it can guide creative outputs towards a more structured narrative.

### Test Scenario: 
"Think step-by-step about how a mysterious old book would reveal its secrets in a short story. First, consider its appearance. Second, imagine the initial interaction. Third, what kind of secret would it hold? Finally, how does the protagonist discover it?

Now, write a short story about a mysterious old book."

### Algorithmic Output Aim: 
A more structured short story with a clear narrative arc, where the discovery of the book's secrets unfolds logically, following the outlined steps.

## 4. Role-Play Prompting

### Description:
This pattern assigns a specific persona or role to the AI, instructing it to generate content from that perspective. This can significantly alter the tone, vocabulary, and overall style of the output.

### Test Scenario:
"You are a seasoned antique dealer with a penchant for the arcane. Write a short story about your encounter with a mysterious old book."

### Algorithmic Output Aim:
A short story told from the perspective of an antique dealer, featuring specialized vocabulary (e.g., patina, provenance), a tone that suggests knowledge and perhaps a touch of skepticism, and an emphasis on the physical characteristics and history of the book.

## Output

## Result

Thus the Comparative Analysis of different types of Prompting patterns and explain with Various Test Scenarios was created successfully.
